# timers

## Introduction

This module defines various types of timers that may be used for measuring single time intervals or for triggering events at even time intervals. Some of the timers are more complex - they can count forward and backward and this way to participate in simulating physical processes - par example heating and cooling of an electronic unit. Most complex timers are capable to produce bursts of impulses.

See project's Wiki for description of the module.

The project is created and tested in MPLAB X / XC8 2.0x compiler. sample/demo.X is a small project that demonstrates usage of some of the timers.
